# paranoid

A simple Quake 1 god mode mod that removes some item pickup limits and increases weapon damage.

My changes:

* Enable pogo stick in client.qc
* Enable immortality in combat.qc
* Ignore max_health limit in items.qc
* Increased axe, missile, lightning, grenade, nail (x100) damage
* Made SuperShotgun spread smaller
* Made rockets faster (x2)
* Gave lightning gun infinite ammo
